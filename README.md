## 🎮 My Origin Story

Numbers and logic have always been part of my life.  
As a kid, I loved charades, logic puzzles, and those brain-twisting games that made you feel like a genius when you finally cracked them.

So it made total sense that I followed that passion and earned my degree in **Mathematics**.  
For a while, I even had the chance to show others how cool math could be — helping kids and adults see that numbers aren't boring at all!

At some point, I stumbled into the world of **Data Analysis**, and it instantly clicked.  
Digging into data to uncover patterns, stories, and surprises feels like solving a mystery. Honestly? It still feels like playing one of those tough logic games... and I live for that "You win!" moment when everything clicks.

That’s how my journey into Data Analytics got started — and it's only getting better.

📍 **Brazilian**, based in Dublin, Ireland  
📊 **Passionate about** turning loads of data into meaningful stories
